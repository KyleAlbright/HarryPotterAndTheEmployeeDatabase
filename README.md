### [Description](#table-of-contents)
In this challenge, we where asked to create an employee database. In this app you can do a number of different things such as view different departments, roles, and employees. You can also add employees, roles, and departments, as well as update an employee's role; in the case they get a promotion. As a bonus this week we where tasked with a few other functions. I chose to add the delete employee, role, and department functionality. I also added the option to update an employees manager, and salary. Lastly I also made it an option to view employee by department.
